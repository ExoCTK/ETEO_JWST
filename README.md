# Installing ExoCTK

If you are using `conda` you can use the `exoctk.yml` to create an environment with the ExoCTK package and its dependencies

    conda env create -f exoctk.yml
    source activate exoctk_demo

If you don't use conda you can use pip to install directly from GitHub

    pip install git+git://github.com/ExoCTK/ExoCTK.git
